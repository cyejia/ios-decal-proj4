## Purpose
    This is an app that challenges users to multitask by taking care of dogs and cats.

## Features
    There are 4 minigames in which the user will play.
    * Walking the dog and avoid obstacles while walking
    * Feeding the dogs food before they faint of hunger
    * Playing fetch with the dogs before they become bored
    * Keeping the dogs asleep by petting them

## Control Flow
    * The user will choose "New Game" and then will move to the game screen.
    * The player loses if at any point if they lose in any of the minigames:
        1. The dogs bump into an obstacle
        2. The dogs faint of hunger
        3. The dogs become bored
        4. The dogs wake up
    * The first game will begin, and the user will play for a limited time
    * After the initial time expires, another minigame will be added to the screen
    * This continues until all minigames are being played at once
    * The speed of each game increases gradually to challenge the user
